# ðŸš€ Full Team Initialization

Initialize all MCP servers with complete project intelligence and context.

## What This Does:

1. **Activates Serena** - Code intelligence with all 6 memory files
2. **Loads Task Master AI** - Project task management
3. **Initializes Shrimp Task Manager** - Task verification system
4. **Connects Sequential Thinking** - Complex problem solving
5. **Enables Memory MCP** - Context persistence
6. **Activates Context7** - Library documentation
7. **Connects Neon** - Database operations
8. **Enables GitHub** - Repository management

## Execution Steps:

### Step 1: Verify MCP Server Status
Use the following MCP tools to check server health:
- List available memories to confirm Serena is active
- Check Task Master AI connection
- Verify all 8 MCP servers are responding

### Step 2: Load Project Context
Read all memory files to load project intelligence:
- project_overview.md - Platform architecture
- tech_stack.md - Dependencies and tools
- code_style_and_conventions.md - Coding standards
- project_structure.md - Directory organization
- suggested_commands.md - Development commands
- task_completion_workflow.md - Quality gates

### Step 3: Initialize Task Systems
Get current task status from both systems:
- Task Master AI: Get next available task
- Shrimp Task Manager: List pending tasks
- Sync task status between systems

### Step 4: Display Startup Summary
Show:
- âœ… Active MCP servers (8/8)
- ðŸ“š Loaded memories (6 files)
- ðŸŽ¯ Next priority task
- ðŸš€ Ready for development

## Ready to Code!
All systems initialized. You now have:
- Full codebase intelligence via Serena
- Task coordination via Task Master AI & Shrimp
- Problem-solving via Sequential Thinking
- Persistent context via Memory MCP
- Library docs via Context7
- Database access via Neon
- Git operations via GitHub

Start with: "What should I work on first?"
