# ðŸŽ¯ Feature Development Workflow

End-to-end process for implementing new features with MCP orchestration.

## Complete Feature Workflow:

### Step 1: Architecture & Design
**Agents**: Sequential Thinking + Serena
```
1. Define requirements using Sequential Thinking
2. Analyze existing code with Serena
3. Design feature architecture
4. Document decisions in Memory
```

### Step 2: Task Planning
**Agents**: Shrimp Task Manager
```
1. Break feature into subtasks
2. Estimate complexity
3. Define acceptance criteria
4. Create implementation guides
```

### Step 3: Implementation
**Agents**: Serena + Task Master AI
```
1. Get next task from Task Master
2. Navigate code with Serena
3. Implement changes
4. Update task status
```

### Step 4: Testing & Verification
**Agents**: Shrimp + Sequential Thinking
```
1. Run test suite
2. Verify against criteria
3. Review code quality
4. Check multi-tenant compatibility
```

### Step 5: Code Review & Refinement
**Agents**: Serena + Memory
```
1. Analyze code with Serena
2. Check for improvements
3. Refactor if needed
4. Save patterns to Memory
```

## Example: Add Supabase Authentication

```bash
# Step 1: Architecture
/team-architect-mcp
# Design: Supabase auth with RLS integration

# Step 2: Planning
/team-shrimp-plan
# Tasks: Setup, Integration, Testing (5 subtasks)

# Step 3: Implementation
/team-task-master next
# Execute each subtask with Serena guidance

# Step 4: Verification
/team-shrimp-verify
# Score: 95/100, all criteria met

# Step 5: Documentation
/team-memory-save "Supabase auth pattern"
# Saved for future features
```

Perfect for: Feature implementation, systematic development, quality assurance
