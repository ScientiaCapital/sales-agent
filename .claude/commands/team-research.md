# ðŸ”¬ Team Research Mode

Comprehensive research using web search, code intelligence, and library docs.

## Research Strategy:

### 1. Define Research Question
Clearly state what you need to understand:
- Technical problem or pattern
- Library or framework usage
- Best practices for a feature
- Performance optimization techniques

### 2. Multi-Source Research

#### Web Search (for patterns & practices)
Use WebSearch for:
- Latest best practices
- Community solutions
- Framework updates
- Performance benchmarks

#### Code Analysis (for implementation)
Use Serena to:
- Find similar code patterns
- Understand existing implementations
- Identify integration points
- Review current architecture

#### Documentation (for APIs & libraries)
Use Context7 to:
- Get library documentation
- Find API references
- See code examples
- Understand dependencies

### 3. Synthesize Findings
Combine insights from all sources:
- Compare approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs
- Choose best solution
- Document decision

## Research Workflows:

### New Technology Integration
```
1. Context7: Get library documentation
2. WebSearch: Find integration patterns
3. Serena: Check current codebase for conflicts
4. Sequential Thinking: Design integration approach
```

### Performance Optimization
```
1. WebSearch: Research optimization techniques
2. Serena: Find performance bottlenecks
3. Context7: Check library performance tips
4. Sequential Thinking: Create optimization plan
```

### Bug Investigation
```
1. Serena: Find bug location and references
2. WebSearch: Search for similar issues
3. Context7: Check library documentation
4. Sequential Thinking: Root cause analysis
```

### Architecture Decision
```
1. Sequential Thinking: Define requirements
2. WebSearch: Research architecture patterns
3. Serena: Analyze current system
4. Context7: Review framework capabilities
5. Memory: Save decision rationale
```

## Example Research:

```
Question: "How to implement Supabase auth with Next.js 15 App Router?"

Step 1: Context7 - Get Supabase docs
- Auth helpers for Next.js
- Server/client components
- Middleware integration

Step 2: WebSearch - Find latest patterns
- Search: "Supabase auth Next.js 15 App Router 2025"
- Find recent blog posts
- Check official examples

Step 3: Serena - Analyze current auth
- Find existing middleware
- Check tenant routing
- Identify integration points

Step 4: Sequential Thinking - Design solution
- Multi-tenant considerations
- RLS policy alignment
- Implementation plan

Step 5: Memory - Save research
- Document chosen approach
- Save key insights
- Create implementation notes
```
