# ðŸŽ­ Team Orchestration - Complex Feature Implementation

Coordinate multiple MCP agents for sophisticated development tasks.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy:

### Phase 1: Architecture & Planning
**Agents**: Sequential Thinking + Serena
- Break down the feature into logical components
- Analyze existing codebase for integration points
- Identify potential conflicts or dependencies

### Phase 2: Detailed Task Breakdown
**Agents**: Shrimp Task Manager
- Split complex tasks into actionable subtasks
- Define verification criteria for each subtask
- Establish dependencies and execution order

### Phase 3: Implementation Coordination
**Agents**: Serena + Task Master AI
- Navigate codebase using Serena's code intelligence
- Track progress using Task Master AI
- Execute changes with proper context

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
**Agents**: Shrimp + Sequential Thinking
- Verify each subtask completion
- Review code quality and patterns
- Validate against project standards

## Orchestration Flow:

1. **Understand Request** - Use Sequential Thinking to analyze requirements
2. **Research Context** - Use Serena to find relevant code
3. **Plan Implementation** - Use Shrimp to create task breakdown
4. **Track Progress** - Use Task Master AI for coordination
5. **Verify Quality** - Use Shrimp to validate completion

## Agent Routing Logic:

- **Code Analysis** â†’ Serena (find_symbol, search_for_pattern)
- **Problem Solving** â†’ Sequential Thinking (step-by-step analysis)
- **Task Management** â†’ Task Master AI (next_task, set_status)
- **Verification** â†’ Shrimp (verify_task, analyze complexity)
- **Context** â†’ Memory (save insights, recall patterns)

## Example Usage:

Feature: "Add Supabase authentication to dual-domain platform"

1. Sequential Thinking: Break down auth requirements
2. Serena: Find existing auth code and integration points
3. Shrimp: Split into subtasks (setup, integration, testing)
4. Task Master: Track implementation progress
5. Shrimp: Verify auth works across all 5 tenants

Perfect for: Architecture changes, new features, complex refactoring
