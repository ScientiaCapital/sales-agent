# Team Orchestrate - Full Team Workflow for Complex Features

Use all MCP servers in concert for complex feature development.

## Workflow

1. **Planning Phase** (Sequential Thinking + Shrimp)
   - Use Sequential Thinking to break down the feature
   - Create detailed plan with Shrimp Task Manager
   - Generate task hierarchy

2. **Architecture Review** (Serena + Memory)
   - Analyze relevant codebase sections with Serena
   - Check Memory for architectural patterns
   - Design solution approach

3. **Task Management** (Task Master AI)
   - Create tasks in Task Master from plan
   - Set dependencies and priorities
   - Expand complex tasks into subtasks

4. **Implementation** (All MCPs)
   - Use Serena for code navigation
   - Update progress in Task Master
   - Save key decisions to Memory
   - Use Sequential Thinking for complex logic

5. **Verification** (Shrimp + Task Master)
   - Verify implementation with Shrimp
   - Update task status
   - Document learnings in Memory

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` - Description of the feature to implement

## Output

Progress report at each phase and final implementation summary.
