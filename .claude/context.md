# Project Context: Sales-Agent - Email Discovery Feature

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01T17:20:00Z

## Current Sprint Focus: Email Discovery Implementation
- **Status**: Sub-Phase 2A COMPLETE ✅ | Sub-Phase 2B In Progress (5 tasks remaining)
- **Branch**: `feature/email-discovery`
- **Latest Commit**: `89c7250` - Comprehensive handoff documentation
- **Working Directory**: `.worktrees/email-discovery/backend`

### Today's Achievements (Sub-Phase 2A - Website Email Extraction)
- ✅ **EmailExtractor Service**: 185 lines of production code with web scraping
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 324 lines across unit and integration tests
- ✅ **Pipeline Integration**: Complete data flow from extraction → enrichment
- ✅ **Critical Bug Fixed**: Discovered and fixed metadata wiring issue
- ✅ **End-to-End Verified**: Full pipeline tested with real contractor leads
- ✅ **Documentation**: 381-line handoff guide for team continuity

### Tomorrow's Goals (Sub-Phase 2B - Hunter.io Fallback)
- [ ] Task 7: Create HunterService class (~1-2 hours)
- [ ] Task 8: Add Hunter.io fallback logic (~1 hour)
- [ ] Task 9: Add cost tracking for API calls (~30 min)
- [ ] Task 10: Run full pipeline test (~30 min)
- [ ] Task 11: Update docs and create PR (~1 hour)

## Architecture Overview
- **Language**: Python 3.13
- **Framework**: FastAPI (web), LangGraph (agent orchestration)
- **Type**: AI/ML Sales Automation Platform
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (checkpointing/caching)
- **Inference**: Cerebras for ultra-fast model execution
- **New**: EmailExtractor service with Hunter.io fallback (in progress)

## Project Description
Enterprise-grade sales automation platform with sophisticated multi-agent AI system. Six specialized agents handle qualification, enrichment, growth analysis, marketing campaigns, BDR workflows, and voice conversations. Achieves 633ms lead qualification using hybrid LangGraph architecture and Cerebras inference.

**New Feature**: Automatic email discovery system that scrapes company websites for contact emails when not provided, with Hunter.io API fallback for enhanced coverage.

## Recent Changes (November 1, 2025)
- **Email Discovery Feature**: Sub-Phase 2A Complete (website scraping)
  - ✅ EmailExtractor service with multi-pattern detection
  - ✅ Smart prioritization (personal > business > generic)
  - ✅ Integrated into QualificationAgent (lines 487-507, 694)
  - ✅ Wired through PipelineOrchestrator (lines 97-102, 187, 223/227)
  - ✅ Non-blocking implementation (continues without email)
  - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration + e2e)
  - ✅ Critical metadata wiring bug discovered and fixed (commit 9f3f948)

## Current Blockers
- None. Sub-Phase 2A complete and verified. Ready for Sub-Phase 2B (Hunter.io).

## Next Steps
1. **Hunter.io Integration** (Sub-Phase 2B): Fallback email discovery via API
2. **Cost Tracking**: Track Hunter.io API costs separately from scraping
3. **Testing**: Full pipeline validation with both extraction methods
4. **Documentation**: Update README, create PR for code review
5. **Production**: Merge feature branch after review and testing

## Development Workflow
```bash
# Email Discovery Development (Current)
cd /Users/tmkipper/Desktop/tk_projects/sales-agent/.worktrees/email-discovery/backend
source ../../../venv/bin/activate
redis-cli ping  # Verify Redis is running

# Run Email Extractor Tests
pytest tests/services/test_email_extractor.py -v

# Run Integration Tests
pytest tests/services/langgraph/test_qualification_email_integration.py -v

# Run End-to-End Pipeline Test
python test_sample_leads.py

# Clear Redis cache when testing updated logic
redis-cli FLUSHDB

# Check git status
git status
git log --oneline -10
```

## Notes
- **Part of GTM Engineer Strategy**: Located at `tmkipper/desktop/tk_projects/gtm_engineer_strategy`
- **Design Patterns**: Factory, Abstract Base Class, Circuit Breaker, TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- **Performance Critical**: All agents have strict latency SLAs (633ms-5000ms range)
- **Cost Efficient**: Ultra-low cost per request ($0.000006 for qualification, +$0.01-0.02 for Hunter.io)
- **Git Worktrees**: Using isolated worktree for email-discovery feature branch
- **Test Coverage**: 96% overall, 100% for new email discovery components
- **Critical Fix**: Metadata wiring bug discovered and fixed (commit 9f3f948) - email now flows through entire pipeline
- **Hunter.io Setup Needed**: Sign up at https://hunter.io/, add API key to `.env` for Sub-Phase 2B
