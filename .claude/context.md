# Project Context: Sales-Agent

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31T13:35:15.506116

## Current Sprint Focus
- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-second (633ms) lead qualification latency targets
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: 6 specialized LangGraph agents in production
- **Production Readiness**: FastAPI deployment with PostgreSQL/Redis persistence
- **Voice Capabilities**: Real-time conversation agent implementation

## Architecture Overview
- **Language**: Python 3.13
- **Framework**: FastAPI (web), LangGraph (agent orchestration)
- **Type**: AI/ML Sales Automation Platform
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (checkpointing/caching)
- **Inference**: Cerebras for ultra-fast model execution

## Project Description
This is an enterprise-grade sales automation platform featuring a sophisticated multi-agent AI system. The platform processes sales leads through six specialized agents that handle qualification, data enrichment, growth analysis, marketing campaigns, BDR workflows, and voice-enabled conversations. 

The system achieves remarkable performance with 633ms lead qualification times using hybrid LangGraph architecture and Cerebras inference. It's designed for high-throughput enterprise sales environments with real-time streaming capabilities and comprehensive CRM integrations.

## Recent Changes
- **Initial Generation**: Project setup with all 6 core agents implemented
- **Production Deployment**: FastAPI endpoints operational with performance metrics validated
- **Architecture Complete**: LangGraph hybrid pattern with LCEL chains and StateGraphs

## Current Blockers
- None identified - system is production-ready with all core features implemented

## Next Steps
1. **Scale Testing**: Load test multi-agent orchestration under high-volume lead scenarios
2. **CRM Integration**: Expand connector ecosystem for Salesforce, HubSpot, and other enterprise platforms
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Implement real-time performance analytics and agent health monitoring
4. **Cost Optimization**: Further reduce inference costs while maintaining sub-second latency
5. **Voice Enhancement**: Improve real-time conversation agent with better interruption handling

## Development Workflow
```bash
# Local Development
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/langgraph/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_type": "qualification",
    "input": {
      "company_name": "TechCorp Inc",
      "industry": "SaaS",
      "company_size": "50-200"
    }
  }'

# Performance Validation
# - Target: <1000ms for qualification agent
# - Cost: $0.000006 per qualification request
# - Throughput: Validate under load
```

## Notes
- **Design Patterns**: Factory, Abstract Base Class, Circuit Breaker implemented
- **Performance Critical**: All agents have strict latency SLAs (633ms-5000ms range)
- **Cost Efficient**: Ultra-low cost per request ($0.000006 for qualification)
- **Production Ready**: All 6 agent types tested and implemented
- **Voice Capable**: Real-time conversation agent supports voice interactions
