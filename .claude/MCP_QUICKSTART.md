## Tips for Success

### ✅ Best Practices
- Always start with `/team-start-advanced`
- Use `/daily-standup-mcp` each morning
- Save important decisions with `/team-memory-save`
- Sync tasks regularly with `/team-sync-tasks`
- Check health with `/team-health-check` when issues occur

### ⚡ Efficiency Hacks
- Use tab completion for command names
- Chain related commands in sequence
- Let agents work together (orchestration)
- Save patterns to Memory for reuse

### 🚫 Common Mistakes
- Don't skip `/team-start-advanced` initialization
- Don't use wrong tool for the job (see MCP Server Roles)
- Don't forget to sync tasks between systems
- Don't ignore `/team-health-check` warnings

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Working?
1. Check if MCP servers are active: `/team-health-check`
2. Restart Claude Code if needed
3. Verify project is activated in Serena

### Task Conflicts?
1. Run `/team-sync-tasks` to synchronize
2. Check both Task Master and Shrimp status
3. Resolve conflicts manually if needed

### Performance Issues?
1. Check MCP response times: `/team-health-check`
2. Reduce concurrent operations
3. Clear caches if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Try it now**: Run `/team-start-advanced`
2. **Get your first task**: Use `/team-task-master next`
3. **Start coding**: Follow task guidance
4. **Save learnings**: Use `/team-memory-save` for insights

Happy coding with your MCP team! 🚀
