# Change Management Policy

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-07
**Classification:** Internal
**SOC 2 Controls:** CC7.2, CC8.1

## Overview

This document defines the change management process for the Sales Agent platform, ensuring that all changes to the production system are properly reviewed, tested, approved, and documented.

## Change Management Principles

1. **No Direct Production Changes:** All changes must go through the defined process
2. **Separation of Duties:** Developers cannot approve their own changes
3. **Traceability:** All changes linked to requirements or issues
4. **Reversibility:** Rollback procedures required for all changes
5. **Documentation:** Changes must be documented and communicated

## Change Categories

### Standard Changes

**Definition:** Pre-approved, low-risk, routine changes

**Examples:**
- Dependency updates (patch versions)
- Configuration adjustments
- Documentation updates
- Non-breaking API additions

**Approval:** Pre-approved, follow standard procedure

### Normal Changes

**Definition:** Moderate risk changes requiring review

**Examples:**
- New features
- API modifications
- Database schema changes
- Third-party integrations

**Approval:** Technical lead + Code review

### Emergency Changes

**Definition:** Critical fixes for production issues

**Examples:**
- Security patches
- Critical bug fixes
- Service outage resolution

**Approval:** On-call engineer + Post-review

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/TASK-123-description

# Implement changes
# Write tests
# Update documentation

# Commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat(module): add new capability

- Implements requirement X
- Includes unit tests
- Updates documentation

Task: TASK-123"
```

### 2. Code Review Process

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Tests included and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Breaking changes identified
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

**Security Review Required For:**
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Encryption implementations
- API security modifications
- Data access changes
- Third-party integrations

### 3. Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All new code must have tests
- Tests must pass in CI/CD

#### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing
- Database integration verification
- External service mocking

#### Security Tests
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Container image scanning

### 4. Deployment Process

#### Pre-Production Stages

1. **Development Environment**
   - Continuous deployment from feature branches
   - Developer testing
   - Initial integration testing

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Production-like configuration
   - Full integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Security scanning

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Scheduled maintenance windows
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Canary releases for major changes
   - Automated rollback capability

## Version Control

### Git Workflow

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- `main` branch protected
- Requires pull request
- Requires code review approval
- Requires CI/CD checks passing
- No force pushes allowed
- Branch must be up to date

### Commit Standards

**Conventional Commits Format:**
```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test updates
- `chore`: Maintenance

### Release Tagging

```bash
# Semantic versioning
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3

Changes:
- Feature X added
- Bug Y fixed
- Security patch Z applied"

git push origin v1.2.3
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Code Quality**
   - Linting (ESLint, Black)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Complexity analysis

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Coverage reporting

3. **Security**
   - Dependency scanning
   - SAST analysis
   - License compliance

4. **Build**
   - Docker image creation
   - Artifact generation
   - Version tagging

5. **Deploy**
   - Environment-specific deployment
   - Database migrations
   - Configuration updates

### Pipeline Configuration

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run linting
      - name: Type checking

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
      - name: Coverage report

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Dependency scan
      - name: SAST scan
```

## Database Changes

### Migration Process

1. **Create Migration**
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add security tables"
```

2. **Review Migration**
- Verify upgrade operations
- Ensure downgrade path exists
- Test in development

3. **Deploy Migration**
- Apply to staging first
- Monitor for issues
- Apply to production

### Rollback Procedure

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
alembic downgrade -1

# Rollback to specific version
alembic downgrade abc123
```

## Security Updates

### Vulnerability Management

**Response Times:**
- Critical: 24 hours
- High: 72 hours
- Medium: 1 week
- Low: Next release

### Dependency Updates

**Automated Scanning:**
- Daily vulnerability checks
- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly full audit

**Update Process:**
1. Automated PR creation
