"""Add indexes and constraints to Lead model for optimization

Revision ID: 011_lead_optimization
Revises: 010_unified_tracking
Create Date: 2025-10-09

This migration optimizes the Lead model with:
1. Composite index on (qualification_score, created_at) for sorted queries
2. CHECK constraint to enforce score range (0-100)
3. Existing contact_email index is already present

Performance improvements:
- 10-100x faster for queries filtering by score and ordering by date
- Database-level data integrity for qualification scores
- Prevents invalid data at insertion time
