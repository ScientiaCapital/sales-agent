"""
Agent Transfer Tools - Enable Multi-Agent Workflow Handoffs

Implements Cerebras cookbook pattern for agent-to-agent transfers.
Allows agents to hand off conversations and tasks to specialized agents.

Pattern from Cerebras sales agent:
- Agents use function tools to transfer control
- Transfer tools return new agent instances
- Context is passed seamlessly between agents
- Each agent has distinct capabilities and prompts

Usage:
    ```python
    from app.services.langgraph.tools.agent_transfer_tools import create_transfer_tools

    # Create transfer tools for qualification agent
    tools = create_transfer_tools(
        current_agent="qualification",
        available_transfers=["enrichment", "growth", "marketing"]
    )

    # Agent can now call transfer tools:
    # - transfer_to_enrichment(reason, context)
    # - transfer_to_growth(reason, context)
    # - transfer_to_marketing(reason, context)
    ```

Transfer Flow:
    1. Agent A determines it needs Agent B's expertise
    2. Agent A calls transfer_to_agent_b(reason="...", context={...})
    3. Transfer tool validates the transfer
    4. Transfer tool routes to Agent B via orchestrator
    5. Agent B receives context and continues workflow
    6. Result flows back through orchestrator
