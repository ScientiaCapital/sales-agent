    Uses smart routing for cost optimization:
    - Simple questions (e.g., "How do I import leads?") → Gemini Flash ($0.00001/1K tokens)
    - Complex troubleshooting (e.g., "CRM sync failing") → Claude Haiku ($0.00025/1K tokens)

User: "I just signed up, where do I start?"
Assistant: Welcome! 🎉 Excited to help you find top contractor leads.

Here's your quickstart path:

**Step 1: Import Your First List** (5 minutes)

**Step 2: Review Top Leads** (10 minutes)
- Filter by tier (start with PLATINUM/GOLD)
- Check multi-OEM and multi-state signals
- Export to your CRM or call list

**Step 3: Set Up Automation** (optional)

- Configure qualification thresholds
- Enable daily imports

Want me to walk you through Step 1 with a sample file? 📊

User: "My match rate is only 40%, is that normal?"
Assistant: A 40% match rate means we're finding licenses for 40% of your contractors - let me help improve that.

**Quick Diagnosis:**
✅ 40% is actually decent for first imports (average is 35-55%)
📈 We can improve this! Here's how:

**Common Causes & Fixes:**

1. **Phone Format Issues** (most common)
   - We normalize automatically, but check source data
   - Ensure 10-digit format (area code + number)
   - Remove international prefixes

2. **Out-of-State Contractors**
   - Currently we have CA, TX, FL, NJ, PA, MA licenses
   - If your list has AZ/NV/CO contractors, we won't match yet
   - Solution: We're adding more states monthly

3. **Business Name Mismatches**
   - DBA vs legal name differences
   - Solution: Phone number is primary match key (99.8% coverage)

**Your Next Steps:**
1. Check what % of your list has valid phone numbers
2. Review which states your contractors are in
3. If mostly CA/TX, let's dig deeper

User: "My CRM sync isn't working"
Assistant: Let's troubleshoot your CRM sync issue.

**Common CRM Sync Problems:**

1. **API Key Issues** (70% of cases)
   - Check: Settings → Integrations → Close CRM
   - Verify: API key starts with "api_" and has no extra spaces
   - Test: Click "Test Connection" button
   - Fix: Regenerate key in Close if needed

2. **Permission Issues**
   - Your Close API key needs "Contacts: Write" permission
   - Check in Close: Settings → API → API Keys
   - Fix: Create new key with full permissions

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Close limits: 600 requests/hour
   - Check: Sync logs for "429 Too Many Requests"
   - Fix: Reduce sync frequency or batch size

**Quick Diagnostic:**
- What error message are you seeing?
- When did it stop working?
- Can you see the "Last Sync" timestamp?

Let me know these details and I'll pinpoint the exact issue! 🔧
